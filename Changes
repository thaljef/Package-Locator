    Now uses IO::Zlib instead of PerlIO::gzip so there is one less
    non-core dependency.

    Added clear_cache() method on the Package::Locator class.
    This deletes the cached index files, causing subsequent
    calls to locate() to fetch the index files anew.

    When calling locate() with a distribution path, we actually
    try and fetch the corresponding URL at each repository.
    This allows you to find distributions that are not in
    the index (i.e. older relases).

    Package::Locator::Index does its own parsing of the index file now,
    and can return the contents as a simple data structure.  Yes,
    I reinvented that wheel.  I have my reasons.

    The locate() method now uses named arguments.  The old positional
    argument interface is not supported.

    The "get_latest" attribute is gone.  Instead, you can specify a
    "latest" argument to the locate() method.

    Fixed some failing tests.  Thanks CPANTESTERS.

    Fixed bug that inadvertenty swallowed all exceptions
    when calling the locate() method.

    Now requires Try::Tiny.

    Found a bunch of bugs by writing test cases.  The first release
    didn't really work as advertised.  This one actually has a chance.
